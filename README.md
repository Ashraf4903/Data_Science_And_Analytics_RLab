# Data Science & Analytics (R)

This repository contains a collection of data science modules and analysis scripts developed using **R**.
It serves as a technical showcase of my proficiency in statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Key Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr
* **Environment:** RStudio

## 📂 Module Highlights

### 1. Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis
* Implementation of complex plotting using `ggplot2`.
* Analysis of distributions, correlations, and outliers in high-dimensional datasets.

### 2. Statistical Modeling
* Application of **Linear & Logistic Regression** models.
* Hypothesis testing and probability distribution analysis.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
* Cleaning raw datasets (handling missing values, normalization).
* Feature engineering and data transformation pipelines.
